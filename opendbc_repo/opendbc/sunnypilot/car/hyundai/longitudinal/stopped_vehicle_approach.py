"""
Stopped Vehicle Approach (SVA) - Aggressive braking strategy for approaching
stopped or nearly-stopped forward vehicles.

Intervenes AFTER the MPC planner to override acceleration targets when
physics demands more aggressive braking than the comfort-oriented MPC provides.

Two-stage approach:
  1. SOFT_APPROACH: moderate confidence, cautious braking (-1.5 to -2.3 m/s^2)
  2. HARD_APPROACH: high confidence, aggressive braking (-2.8 to -3.4 m/s^2)

Minimum stopping gap: 1.9m planner target -> ~1.5m (5ft) real-world.
